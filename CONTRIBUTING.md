# Contributing to these nvidia wrappers

If you would like to make a contribution to this project, I would appreciate it.

## Help wanted

I would appreciate help working towards:

- Full automation
- More operating system coverage
- Ease of use

## First Steps towards a pull request

* [Make a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* (Optional) Check the
  [Issues page](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/nvidia/issues) for
  something you can contribute towards.
  * (Optional) If you do not see the item that you would like changed on the
    list, submit a
    [new issue](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/nvidia/issues/new)
    for something that you would like to see changed.
* Create a fork of the repository on GitHub.  This will redirect you to a new
page titled YOURUSERNAME / nvidia.

## Pull request

* Create a new branch from your fork.  Name the branch based on what you
  intend to change such as fixing-spelling-errors.
* Make changes.  Less is more.
* An option to create a pull request will appear at the top of the main page.
* Explain the reasoning behind the change in the pull request.

## After the pull request

(Optional) After a change is merged, you can delete the branch and make a new
branch for the next change.  If you are done working on the fork after the
change, the repository can be deleted.
